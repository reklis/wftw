							<h4>What is the Christmas Bazaar?</h4>
							<p>Each year many people accross the world die from disease due to lack of clean water. The vision of this event is to provide an opportunity to support tons of local vendors while doing good for the world by providing clean water. Americans spend around $450 billion dollars on Christmas gifts each year. While giving gifts is not necessarily bad, consumerism has take over in America and we have lost our sense of world view.  The Chiristmas Bazaar aims to take a small portion of that money and provide life to those whithout clean water around the world. The video below is the spark that started all of this...</p>

							<h4>This Year's Event</h4>
							<p>This is our first year of doing this and we hope it will continue into the future. That being said we have around 20 vendors ranging from food to wares. Vendors will be set up around the facility with their goods either ready to sell on the spot or take orders. All vendors are required to put at a minimum, 10% of ALL prodeeds to the this year's charity organization, <a href="www.water.cc" style="color:#FFF;text-decoration:underline">Living Water International</a>. Each vendor will have a sign showing what percent of their sales are going to be donated so that you know exactly how much you are giving to the cause of clean water.</p><p>We will be holding hourly raffles for products that each vendor has donated. Raffle tickets are 1 for $3.00 or 3 for $5.00. 100% of proceeds collected from the raffle will be added to the donation.</p><p>If you are interested, there will be the ability to register at the event in order to see the final totals as well as follow up with how much was collected in total and where the donations went to help, as well as another other information we can get our hands on to show where your support has gone and what it did.
